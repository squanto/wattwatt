      <h2>WattWatt Energy Revolution</h2>
      <p>The existing finance available to solar installers and their customers offers high costs, 
        unfair conditions, and slow service. At the same time, customers at banks see very poor interest rate 
        instruments and have no connection to what their capital is funding. The space is rife 
        with middle-men involved to ensure a smooth process. With blockchain, 
        less middle-men are necessary because the process is governed by the community and not 
        individual entities. Individuals within the community have an ownership stake and are 
        incentivized to be active. This sets up a solution that aligns the community and 
        solar developers. They are incentivized to keep away undesirable and risky projects 
        from entering the space to begin with and care about the overall health of the 
        platform and its projects.</p>
